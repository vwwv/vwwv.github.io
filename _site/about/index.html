<p>Hi! Here Alejandro; I’m a freelance software engineer based on berlin, and started this blog to share some experience I
gathered while working on some exciting projects, to show and get feedback about a few ideas/personal-projects I’m 
developing, and to exposure whatever I find interesting about technology in general and programming in particular.</p>

<p>The areas I feel more confident with are functional programming, cryptocurrencies such bitcoin, custom scripts 
implementation to handle data or manage systems, and TOR hidden services development; I’ll try to keep writing posts 
about these topics from time to time.  Also if you are looking for a developer and feel I could fit for the task, 
don’t hesitate to get in contact with me or to  take a look at my <a href="https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~014a50cec3ebecd362/">UpWork profile</a> (*)</p>

<h3 id="the-blogs-name">The blog’s name:</h3>

<p>The name of the blog, the big spaghetti code ball, came after reading a big, messy, over-complicated Java code; so ugly 
and exagerated (objects calling objects calling back theirselves, inheriting from 5-words-composed classes implementing 
hyped “OOP patterns”™, objects as arguments to dispatch the dispatcher for the scheduler…you know, Java…). Anyway, after 
that, was so frustrated, I really need to talk about it, but working remotely makes it not as simple as one’d like…</p>
