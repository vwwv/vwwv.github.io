### Me :

Hi! Here Alejandro; I’m a freelance software engineer based on berlin, started this blog to share some experience I
gathered while working on some exciting projects, to show and get feedback about a few ideas/personal-projects I’m 
developing, and to exposure whatever I find interesting about technology in general and programming in particular.


### The blog’s name:

The name of the blog, the _spaghetti code ball_, came after reading a big, messy, over-complicated Java code; so ugly 
and exaggerated (objects calling objects calling back themselves, inheriting from 5-words-composed classes implementing 
"OOP patterns"™, dispatcher dispatching dispatches factories…). Anyway, after that, was so frustrated, I really need to talk 
about it…
